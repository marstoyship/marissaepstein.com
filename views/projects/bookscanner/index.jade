  section.project-section.project-description
    p BookScanner allows users to view and save book reviews, by scanning a bookâ€™s barcode or through searches. This project was a full branding and user experience overhaul for existing app: we began with the logo, which evolved into the app icon, then continued with an information architecture phase, followed by a new, polished interface design (soon to be implemented).
