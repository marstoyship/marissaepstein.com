    p Participating in the 2013 Hasbroathon weekend with the Fighmints team, combined with an obsessive fandom for both the boardgame and movie <i>Clue</i>, could only lead to this. The team demoed All Aboard, a platform for game developers to launch apps that connect devices together, letting an iPad serve as a 'board' for many players. Below, the All Aboard concept is illustrated with a modern redesign of Clue, including the board and several player's iPhone hands.
