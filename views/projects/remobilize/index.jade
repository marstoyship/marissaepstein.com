    p Mike Kelly took his research and experience as a personal tranier to put together an in-depth 6 week remobilizing program. His book, <i>Remobilize</i>, is a detailed walkthrough of that program and expression of his positive, progressive attitude. This project included a branding system of dynamic rings that aligned as you progress, featured within the book design.
