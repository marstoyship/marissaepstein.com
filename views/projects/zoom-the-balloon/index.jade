  section.project-section.project-description
    p I am proud to say that Zoom the Balloon was the result of 2013's Node Knockout, a world-wide, remote, 48-hour hackathon. I'm prouder to say that we won, for Best Design! It's a deceptively simple vertical-scrolling game, with the mission of getting Zoom to the moon fast, while carefully maneuvering through stars and clouds. I designed the site (where you can download or play), the game level (plus architecting the mechanics), the pre- and post-game screens, and of course our little Zoom.
