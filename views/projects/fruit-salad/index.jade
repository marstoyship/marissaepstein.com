  section.project-section.project-description
    p Fruit salad is a throwback on many levels. This project took place in college, and was the last of many requiring traditional photography. Man, do I miss that dark room. These still lifes were lit and shot on a sweep with a large format camera. We're talking 4x5 inch negatives that cost dollars each, and are loaded one at a time. But it was worth it, to create a large, hand-bound hardcover of a dozen color fruit photographs, laid out with unique facts about each. Below is my favorite mix.
