  section.project-section.project-description
    p Community Teamwork creates housing, education and economic opportunities that reduce poverty and strengthen communities. Together, the Figmints team updated Community Teamwork's branding and website, adding their caring personality to all designs and making their content mobile-accessible for users without computers. We also re-organized their subsidiary structure, adding clarity with an intensive architecture process.
