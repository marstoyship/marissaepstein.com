        I know that everyone and their mother says they’re passionate. But I would still have to say I’m obsessed. Addicted. Intoxicated. Sue me.

        I’ve been drinking the design Kool-Aid ever since I was a kid in Florida—doodling with my architect parents; creating vectors of robots and dinosaurs in a magnet arts high school. At the University of Cincinnati, I had my eyes opened by Swiss design, and contributed to major brands during multiple internships. Since graduating, I’ve had the privilege of designing for a living and reinvesting in a constant flow of design-related books and additions to my designer toy collection. It’s a vicious cycle. My expanding obsession led me to a love of web design, plus countless crushes on great user experiences. I’m still thirsty for knowledge and new opportunities. Cheers.
